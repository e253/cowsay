# Cowsay

Cowsay is a desktop app inspired by the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay).

I made it to test tauri updates over TOR with TORProject's new [pure rust client](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti).

Hopefully it can be used to test other [Tauri](tauri.app) experiments.
