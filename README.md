# Cowsay

Cowsay is a silly desktop app inspired by and powered by the original [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay).

It serves as a test app for doing tauri updates over TOR with TORProject's new [pure rust client](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti).

It's pretty simple, and should suffice as a test app for any other [Tauri](tauri.app) experiments.
